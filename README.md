##Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Monika Chuchro

Submission of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

##Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository
Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
Project Summary

##The following is a summary description of the project instructions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
